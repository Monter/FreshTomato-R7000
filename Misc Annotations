EDIT: I'll post other findings to THIS POST as I remember them/find them and if anyone has anything else to contribute, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Additionally, once I get a "good" setup going (which should be soon at this point), I'll try and make a new topic that's actually a bit more through, organized, and useful.

====================================================

Turned out "N" actually enables AC/N!

Using Metageek inSSIDer, Windows Connection Properties (Win10) or a windows netsh command:

netsh wlan sh networks bssid

Notes

For 20/40/80mhz channel bandwidth

Set bandwidth (40mhz, 80mhz) then save

Set Upper/Lower then save

Lastly set channel then save

Static DHCP (via DNS Masq Custom) Under Advanced -> DHCP/DNS -> Custom DNS Masq Entries Text Block

dhcp-host=mac,ip,hostname,(lease time)

one line per mac/device. Leave lease time blank for infinite. This is handy if you've got a list of your machines and just want to throw stuff into a text file.

I had issues with the "Static DHCP" in basic options remembering "most" but not all of my devices. This seems to work fully.

Check Tx Power

via ssh connection to the router, issue the following command

wl -i eth1 txpwr1

wl -i eth2 txpwr1

Should return 1496mW if running at Default Power setting.

Overclock CPU to 1200Mhz (at your own risk!)

nvram set clkfreq=1200,800 nvram commit && reboot

*Note: While some people have reported success at 1400Mhz, I'm not one of them so I will discourage you from attempting it. It killed my network connections and "soft bricked" - I had to power down, reboot, ssh in, clock down, and commit. If I didn't do it fast enough, it locked back up. 1200Mhz - temps seem to be +/- 1 degree F of the defaults. My reading tells me 1600 is virtually guaranteed to fail.

I think I'm going to draft up a list of notes of things I found and post it up on here once I a) figure shit out b) make sure I'm right c) have time.

So...probably never, but wish me luck


====================================================
To be added:
------------

USB - Setup and now running Entware.

Entware - configured and allowed me to install Git, Curl, etc.

Git - works -- pulled in Fail2Ban

curl/python-curl -- works

Python -- works, running Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban -- Appears to work!

OpenVPN -- There's tons of these references already, but hey...why not.
